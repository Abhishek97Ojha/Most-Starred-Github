# Most Starred Repo (Company Project - 01)

## Project Overview
The task is to implement a small webapp that will list the most starred Github repos that were created in the last 30 days. There will also be a simple drill down feature that displays a time series graph of various metrics for the given repository. You'll be fetching the sorted JSON data directly from the Github API.
